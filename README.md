# OnPoint
# A prevalent issue in a student's life is successful time management. With a rapidly developing world, time management is a 
# skill required to achieve success and balance in life especially with work. Therefore, to ensure that students are ready for real world 
# speed and experiences, our team has decided to develop OnPoint✔ that will generate weekly schedules, for individuals of all ages, to 
# allow students to easily undertake responsibility.

# OnPoint✔ will take in student responses of course titles, the days on which the student has that particular course, and course 
#start / end timing to return a schedule based on this inputted data. OnPoint✔ also takes in extra-curricular activities based on their 
# school and places these into the schedule. The student can also add daily chores, or daily family time, to the schedule, by clicking 
# the "Add Events" option.

# We built OnPoint✔ with the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
